# OPM Development Environment - Solution

## Problem Identified
The workflow was failing because it expected `npm run dev` to exist in the root package.json, but only a `test` script was defined.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Working Development Environment
- **Backend Server**: Runs on port 4000, connects to MongoDB database
- **Frontend Server**: Runs on port 5000, serves React application with Vite
- **Both servers**: Successfully tested and working

### 2. Files Created
- `index.js` - Main entry point that starts both servers
- `vite.config.js` - Vite configuration to run frontend from root directory
- `dev.js` - Alternative development script
- `start-app.js` - Executable development script

### 3. Dependencies Installed
All necessary dependencies are installed at the root level:
- Frontend: React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Axios, React Router
- Backend: Express, MongoDB, JWT, Bcrypt, Cloudinary, Stripe
- Development: Nodemon, Concurrently, ESLint

### 4. Configuration
- Frontend configured to run on port 5000 (as expected by workflow)
- Backend runs on port 4000 with database connection
- Proper cleanup handlers for both processes

## How to Run the Application

### Option 1: Using the main entry point
```bash
node index.js
```

### Option 2: Using the development script
```bash
node dev.js
```

Both options will start:
- Backend API on http://localhost:4000
- Frontend App on http://localhost:5000

## Solution for Workflow Issue

The workflow expects `npm run dev` to exist. To fix this, the root package.json needs to be updated with:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "node index.js",
    "start": "node index.js",
    "build": "cd client && npm run build",
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  }
}
```

## Current Status
✅ Backend server working - connects to database
✅ Frontend server working - serves React app
✅ All dependencies installed and configured
✅ Development environment ready
❌ Workflow still failing due to missing `dev` script in root package.json

## Next Steps
1. Update root package.json to include the `dev` script
2. Restart the workflow
3. The application will be fully functional
